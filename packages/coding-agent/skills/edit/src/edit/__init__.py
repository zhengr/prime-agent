    ``old_str`` must appear exactly once in the file at ``path``; that match is
    replaced with ``new_str`` and the file is written back in place. Prefer this
    over rewriting a whole file for targeted edits.

    Args:
        path: File to edit, relative to the working directory, absolute, or
            `~`-prefixed (the leading `~`/`~user` is expanded to the home dir).
        old_str: Exact text to find. Must occur exactly once in the file.
        new_str: Replacement text.

    Returns:
        A short confirmation message.

        FileNotFoundError: If ``path`` does not exist.
        ValueError: If ``old_str`` is absent or matches more than once.
